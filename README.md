# Dog-Breed-Prediction

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are primarily used to classify images. In this notebook the breed of a dog is predicted based on a pretrained CNN (named VGG19).

At the end of this project, a user-supplied image can be given as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
