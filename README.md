# Dog-Breed-Prediction

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are primarily used to classify images. In this notebook the breed of a dog is predicted based on a pretrained CNN (named VGG16). It is trained on ImageNet, a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks. ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of 1000 categories.

At the end of this project, a user-supplied image can be given as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
